# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Basics

Welcome to my JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) basics repository! ðŸ“š

This repository serves as a collection of my journey into the fundamentals of DSA using JavaScript. Here, you'll find basic implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and software development.

## Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures

#### Array
- **Description**: An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations and can hold multiple values under a single name.
- **Implementation**: Basic array operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

#### Queue
- **Description**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Implementation**: Basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

#### Stack
- **Description**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Implementation**: Basic stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.

#### Linked List
- **Description**: A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node.
- **Implementation**: Basic linked list operations including insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Non-Linear Data Structures

#### Tree
- **Description**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It has a root node, branches, and leaves.
- **Implementation**: Basic tree operations like insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching.

#### Trie
- **Description**: A trie (pronounced as "try") is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys in a large set of strings.
- **Implementation**: Basic trie operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

#### Graph
- **Description**: A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes.
- **Implementation**: Basic graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), traversal (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search), and shortest path algorithms.

#### Hash Table (Hash Map)
- **Description**: A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- **Implementation**: Basic hash table operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
